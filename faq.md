**What is Nice Fake News?**  
Fake news, unlike satire, is news meant with the intention of deceiving the public. Nice Fake News is fake news that does this for a good cause: to inspire kindness, crush fear, or simply warm hearts.

**Why have you created Nice Fake News?**  
Fake news has been used by our enemies to change the results of elections and defame the innocent. Until the real news fights back, the fake one must stand in.

**Who created Nice Fake News?**  
NFN is created by notorious Russian hacker [Оли Фрост](http://olifro.st). Like most fake news it is supported by [overseas investment](/donate/) and a [group of hackers](/joinus/).

**How easy is it make fake news?**  
Over [6 in 10 people will share a link without reading it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/08/08/59-percent-of-you-will-share-this-article-without-even-reading-it/#7782c6032a64). Furthermore, like other fake news sites, NFN spoofs the appearance of a trusted news source like CNN.


**Why can't I see the posts on your Facebook/Twitter?**  
Nice Fake News uses a common technique called 'dark posting'. It means posts can be promoted without being made public.

**Isn't lying always wrong?**  
Nice Fake News is grounded in a pragmatist theory of truth and a utilitarian idea of right action. If it's a useful belief, it's a belief you should have – and any amount of deception is justified if it will maximise happiness.


**How can I help?**  
If you are a writer you can [write a story](/submit), if you are a hacker you can [seed a story](/joinus), and if you're rich you can [fund story promotions](/donate) in cash or bitcoin.

**Can I use the images on this site?**  
Yes you can.

**My cat has just had kittens. Will you share my story?**  
No. We only publish false nice news stories.
