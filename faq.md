**What is NFN (Nice Fake News)?**  
NFN is fake news site that publishes only the nicest lies – the ones that crush fears, bring smiles, and make you almost want to be a good person.

**Why have you created Nice Fake News?**  
Fake news has had a lot of bad press for tearing our world apart. We just want to use it to make the world a nicer place.

**Who created Nice Fake News?**  
NFN is created by [Anonynice](/nfn/joinus), a group founded by friendly Russian hacker <a href="http://olifro.st" class="russian">Оли Фрост</a>. Like most fake news it is also supported by [offshore financing](/nfn/donate).

**How do you make Nice Fake News?**  
Over [6 in 10 of you will share a link without reading it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/08/08/59-percent-of-you-will-share-this-article-without-even-reading-it/#7782c6032a64).

**How is fake news different to satire?**  
Fake news, unlike satire, is news meant with the intention of deceiving the public. Nice fake news does this too, but for good causes.

**Why can't I see your posts on Facebook/Twitter?**  
Nice Fake News uses a common technique called 'dark posting' which means posts can be promoted without being made public.

**How can I help?**  
Share a story in your feed and spread some niceness. If you're a writer you can [write a story](/nfn/submit), if you're a hacker you can [seed a story](/nfn/joinus), and if you have money you can [fund story promotions](/nfn/donate) in cash or bitcoin.

**Can I share the images/videos on this site?**  
Yes, [download some here](/nfn/images.zip). The site is also open source.

**You haven't answered my question?**  
Then you must email <a class="russian" href="mailto:mail@olifro.st" >Оли Фрост</a>.

**My cat has just had kittens. Will you share my story?**  
No. We only publish false nice news stories.
